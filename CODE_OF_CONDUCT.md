# Code of conduct file 

DSCI 522 Group 16 is composed of members from diverse backgrounds with a varied set of skills, personalities, and experiences.  We as equal contributors to this project will strive to create an inclusive and open environment for all of us to work together, demonstrate our abilities, and foster continued growth. This Code of Conduct outlines how we must interact in order to maintain an inclusive and positive group free of harassment or prejudice.

All team members and those who we will interact with over the course of completing this project have the right to be treated with respect. In regards to expected behavior, all team members are to participate in a professional, inclusive, and open way with the goal of creating a collaborative environment regardless regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Below are examples of unacceptable behavior by team members (it is not exhaustive but should give an idea of the expectations):
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

In the event a teammate is found in violation of the above principles, the event will be reviewed by the team as a whole and an appropriate action will be decided (not limited to: a warning, removal from the team, or elevating the issue to UBC staff).
